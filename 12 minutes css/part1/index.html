        <p>Bangladesh is a land of mystery and intrigue. The country is centuries old and while it has seen many visitors over the years, it is only now starting to experience a commercial tourism boom. In many respects, Bangladesh is a land of opportunity and adventure. All you need do is step out and discover its many mysteries for yourself.
There are so many things to be enjoyed here. Perhaps one of the most popular activities is that of sunning yourself on the exquisite white sandy beaches of Cox’s Bazaar and Teknaaf. Both beaches are situated on the eastern coast of the Bay of Bengal and are relatively unspoilt by tourists making them a great place to spend vacation time. Another attraction is the many archaeological sites in the country. They are interesting from a cultural and architectural point of view and can be fascinating to tour. Bangladesh’s other attraction is a bit more lively – the Royal Bengal Tigers which have become somewhat of a trademark for the country. These stunning big cats are somewhat protected in the country and are stunning to behold!.</p>
        <p> Bangladesh is also home to the longest sea beach, the largest tea gardens and some amazing exotic animal life. To top it off, the people of the country are colorful and friendly and have a fascinating culture. There is a lot to do here. You can choose things such as trekking and adventure tours. Most of the activities give you the opportunity to take in the beautiful green mountains, sparkling rivers and clear vistas. The natural wealth of the area is, in many respects, unbeatable. Bangladesh is a paradise just waiting to be discovered!</p>
        <p>Now begin the post-wedding rituals. Basar Ghar is the welcoming of the newly married couple into the bride’s home. There is a great feast with festivities. Bashi Biye reforms to a ritual the next morning when the groom places vermilion on the forehead of the bride. They then go to the mandap to worship the Sun God. Vidaai is the departure of the newly-weds to the grooms house. Bou Baran is the welcoming at the groom’s house. The bride dips her feet in a plate of lac dye with milk and enters the house. Bou Bhat is the bride’s first meal at her in-laws house. A reception is then held in the evening. Phool Sajja is the last Bengali wedding custom where the couple is dressed in new clothes. The nuptial bedroom is adorned with flowers.Perhaps when you are visiting the country you will see a marriage procession and witness some of the wedding customs of Bangladesh.</p>
